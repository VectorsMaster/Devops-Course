# Lab 1: Web Application Development

## Overview

This is a simple web app that renders current time in Moscow, implemented with Flask framework because its simplicity and flexibility in the main implementation and testing.

## Implementation details

I followed the best practices while implementing the app. I followed the project structure mentioned in the official documents, stored all requirements and libraries needed in one file and documented complex instructions. Furthermore, I explained how to run the app in `README.md` file in app_python directory.

## Testing details (Unit tests)

I followed testing best practices in flask and created 3 main Unit Tests.

1. Test to check whether the app is responding to get requests
2. Test to chech whether the app is rendering time block
3. Test to check whether time changes upon refreshing (subsequent requests)

## Code quality details

I used autopep8 to format `.py` files.
